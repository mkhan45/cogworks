    "This notebook provides some insight into [pulse code modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation), which is the process that we have been discussing for digitally representing an analog signal. As discussed in class, the digital encoding  of an analog signal, via PCM, is characterized by two primary factors:\n",
    "1. The **sampling rate**: the number of times that we sample the analog signal each second (sampling evenly in time)\n",
    "2. The **bit-depth**: the number of bits that we can use to record the amplitude of the signal. E.g. A 4-bit encoding would only permit us to use only $2^4 = 16$ distinct amplitude values in our digital representation of the signal"
