More can be read about them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer)."

    "The `frames` variable points to bytes in memory and we are going to read that memory expecting 16-bit integer-values. We will store these frames as NumPy arrays and combine them into a single array with the following two lines of code.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# read in the recorded audio, saved as a numpy array of 16-bit integers\n",
