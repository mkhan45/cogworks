    "[mygrad](https://mygrad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a so-called \"automatic differentiation\" (a.k.a \"autograd\") numerical library. This means that `mygrad` is able to calculate results from mathematical functions, and then evaluate the *derivatives* (slopes) of those functions. Note that `mygrad` cannot compute analytical derivatives (i.e. the function that describes the derivative at all points). `mygrad` can only find the derivative evaluated at specified values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an exceedingly-simple function, $f(x) = 2x + 1$. This is a line with a slope of 2. Thus the derivative of this function should be $2$ for all values of $x$. I.e. $\\frac{df(x)}{dx} = 2$. Let's see that `mygrad` can produce this result.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we specify the point, $x$, at which we want to evaluate this function. Let's use $x = 5.0$, and compute $f(5.0)$:"
